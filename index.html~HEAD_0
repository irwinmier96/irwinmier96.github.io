    <p>The FitnessGram‚Ñ¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively
       gets more difficult as it continues. <br>
       The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. <br>
        Line up at the start.
         The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. <br>
         [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. <br>
         [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. <br>
         The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. <br>
         The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.<br>

       I watch Riverdale to roast the bad lines they are 
       all given, especially Veronica's, her lines are 
       the worst lol <br>
       Also, its kinda annoying how I'm literally <br>
       younger than almost EVERYONE IN THE CAST <br>
       and I am not even 24 years old yet <br>
       Like these 27 year olds really be <br>
       playing 16 year olds and doing <br>
       the most sexualized dances in a musical <br>
       like bruh I just got off the phone with the chief <br>
       and he said this aint it <br>
       Also Cole Sprouse tries way too hard to be edgy sorry not sorry <br>
